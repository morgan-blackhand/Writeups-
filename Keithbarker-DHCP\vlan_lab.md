# Lab Instructions

## Introduction
This lab involves configuring switches and routers to handle spanning tree protocol, setting up hostnames and timeouts, configuring interfaces, and setting up VLANs and DHCP pools.

## Step 1: Understand the Lab Directions

## Step 2: Configure Switches
First, we need to paste our configuration script into our switches so they can automatically handle spanning tree, and we can have an easier time later with hostnames and timeouts already set up.

```plaintext
conf t
vtp domain OGIT
int range fa0/11, fa0/22
switchport mode trunk
end
```

## Step 3: Configure Interfaces
We will configure the interfaces of the switches. The Layer 2 switches use the same ports to connect, so they will use the same commands. For the Layer 3 switch, weâ€™ll enable encapsulation and configure trunking. Also, ensure to create the required VLANs (10, 20, and 777) on each switch.

## Step 4: Setup DHCP
For the final step of setting up DHCP, we need to configure our DHCP pools and the helper addresses on the Layer 3 router.
